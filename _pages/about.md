I am Yu Zhang (张宇 in Chinese), a second-year Ph.D student at the Department of Integrated Circuits Engineering, The Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT). Prior to that, I graduated from The Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2024.

<!-- Prior to that, I graduated from Zhejiang University in 2025. I had the privilege to complete a research internship at NYU SAI Lab under the supervision of [Prof.Sai Qian Zhang](https://saiqianzhang.com/). I was also fortunate to collaborate with [Prof.Cheng Tan](https://tancheng.github.io/) from Google and [Prof.Jeff Zhang](https://search.asu.edu/profile/4346755) from ASU. Prior to this, I greatly appreciated the mentorship of [Prof.Zeke Wang](https://wangzeke.github.io/) at RC4ML at ZJU. -->
